# DJ_app

A simple DJ app.  
This is a follow along project from my University C++ course. Dr. Matthew King got us going with the basic application and we had to expand the functionality. My work includes a graphic overhaul, adding the full reverb functionality, better play/pause/stop behavior and the fully developed library.

## How the program works: 
The using the two decks, one can mix different audio tracks. Deck controls include: volume, speed, position, reverb and other basic functionality. Another feature is a library. It can store all music in a data.xml file for easy retrieval and searching.

## Requirements: 
  - C++ 
  - Projucer Library   
With projucer installed one can just compile all cpp files with the aid of projuicer. The .jucer file is essential to compile the application with the juce framework.
