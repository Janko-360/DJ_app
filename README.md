# DJ_app

A simple DJ app. 
This is a follow along from my University C++ course. The professor got us going and we had to expand the functionality for the project sibmission.

## How the program works: 
The using the two decks, one can mix different audio tracks. Deck controls include: volume, speed, position, reverb and other basic functionality. Another feature is a library. It can store all music in a data.xml file for easy retrieval and searching.

## Requirements: 
  - C++ 
  - Projucer Library 
With projucer installed one can just compile all cpp files with the aid of projuicer. The .jucer file is essential to compile the application with the juce framework.
